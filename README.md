## üåü Overview
Experience enterprise-grade real-time communications powered by ASP.NET Core SignalR with WebSocket transport. This sophisticated chat platform built with ASP.NET Core 8 and MudBlazor demonstrates high-performance real-time capabilities while combining the most engaging features from Viber and Snapchat. Watch as messages and reactions flow instantly between users through SignalR's robust real-time infrastructure.
## Server-side Implementation
- First, install the required NuGet package in the Client project:
  
  ``` dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client

- Server-Side Implementation:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;

public class ChatHub : Hub
{
    // Hub methods will be implemented here
    // This class handles real-time communication between clients
}
```
- Configure SignalR in the Server's Program.cs:
```csharp
// Add SignalR services
builder.Services.AddSignalR();

// Map the ChatHub to a specific endpoint
app.MapHub<ChatHub>("/chathub");
```
## Client-Side Implementation:
- In your Blazor components, add the SignalR client namespace:
```csharp
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client
@inject NavigationManager Navigation
```
